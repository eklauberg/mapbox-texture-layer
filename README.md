# TextureLayer

An effort to create a TextureSource based on raster tiles and a TextureLayer style to allow manipulation of tiles with shaders. It uses the mapbox custom layer interface and built-in tiling system.

The project uses as much mapbox-gl code as possible to ensure forward compatibility.
This is not a production release but currently successfully draws tiles using custom shaders
